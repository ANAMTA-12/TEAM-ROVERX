LINUX COMMANDS

Linux is an open-source operating system that's known for its flexibility, security, and stability. Unlike Windows or macOS, which are proprietary, Linux is freely available and can be modified by anyone. Itâ€™s widely used for servers, software development, and even personal computing, with various distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux.

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO STILL USE TEXT COMMANDS IN THIS ADVANCED WORLD?

i. We have more control over the machines, we can run commands to change permissions, view hidden files, interact with databases, start servers, manage processes, etc. ii. It is faster for example we can make 10,000 files in a single line. iii. We can also automate things. iv. Easily available everywhere. v. Requirement in the market.

 The operating system is divided into two parts where one is Microsoft and the second is everything related to Unix.
 What is Unix?
 Unix is a powerful, multitasking, multiuser operating system originally developed in the late 1960s at  Bell Labs. It's known for its simplicity, portability, and robustness, forming the foundation for many modern operating systems, including Linux and macOS. It is referred as the "father" of many operating system.
