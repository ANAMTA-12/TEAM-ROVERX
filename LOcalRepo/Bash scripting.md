 BASH
 Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell—a modern replacement for the original Unix shell (sh).
 It’s a command-line interpreter used in Linux and Unix systems.
 It’s the default shell in most Linux distributions.
 It is basically like a robot assistant that helps you perform certain task by typing some commands.

 BASH SCRIPTING
Bash scripting is writing a series of Bash commands in a file (usually ending in .sh) to automate tasks.
Instead of typing commands one by one, you write them once and run the script whenever needed.
It’s like teaching your computer a routine—once, and it remembers forever.
