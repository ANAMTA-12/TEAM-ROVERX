IMAGE PROCESSING:-
In a normal way if we look at a photo and instantly noticing colors, shapes, and faces. Now imagine if we teach a computer to do the same. That’s image processing.
It’s all about converting images into data that a machine can understand. An image is basically a giant grid of pixels—tiny dots that hold color and brightness
information. Image processing techniques help us clean up, enhance, or analyze that grid.
Some of its techniques are:-
i.Filtering to sharpen or blur parts of the image.
ii.Edge Detection to find boundaries and shapes, like sketching the outlines of objects.
iii.Thresholding to turn complex photos into simple black and white maps super useful for pattern recognition.
iv.Transformations to rotate, resize, or warp images however we need.

COLOUR THEORY:-
Color theory in image processing involves understanding how colors are represented and manipulated. In OpenCV, colors are handled using various color spaces:
1.RGB (Red, Green, Blue):- Additive color model. Standard in most display systems.
2.BGR:-OpenCV stores images in Blue-Green-Red order by default.
3.HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value): Useful for color segmentation tasks.
4.Grayscale: Simplified image where each pixel carries intensity only.

HISTOGRAM EQUILIZATION:-
An image histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of pixel intensity values in an image. For grayscale images, it shows how many pixels 
have intensity 0,1,2 upto 255.
i.X-axis:-Pixel intensity values (0 to 255)
ii.Y-axis:-Number of pixels at each intensity level
In pratice:-
Input image:-May look dull or underexposed.
Equalized image:-Appears more vivid and sharp especially useful in satellite images, medical imaging, and nighttime photos.
Some types:-
i.Standard Histogram Equalization:-Equalizes a grayscale image.
ii.CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization):-Works on small tiles of the image to prevent overenhancement.
iii.Color Histogram Equalization:-Use on lightness channel in LAB or YUV space.

THRESHOLDING:-
Thresholding is a segmentation technique in image processing where we separate objects from the background.It simplifies image data, which makes tasks like object
detection, contour finding, and OCR (optical character recognition) more efficient.
Some of its types:-
i.Simple Thresholding:-Applies one global threshold to all pixels	
ii.Inverse Thresholding:-Similar to simple, but reverses the white/black assignment	
iii.Otsu's Method:-Calculates optimal threshold automatically	
iv.Adaptive Thresholding:-Threshold is calculated for small regions independently
