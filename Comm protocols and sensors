Communication protocols and sensors:-
Communication protocols are basically the rules of communication between two electronic devices.It's just like how two robots or two computers trying to establish
connections with each other like how to talk,when to talk and what languages to use to interact with each other.
Sensors are electronic devices that try to detect changes in the physical world and convert them into digital signals that systems can understand.

IMU:-
It stands for Inertial Measurement Unit.It measures angular rate,force and sometimes magnetic field.IMU contains some devices which have measuring tools which
perform specific tasks for example 3-axis gyroscope + accelerometer would make 6-axis IMU and 9-axis IMU consist of accelorometer, gyroscope and magnetometer.
Accelerometer measures change of velocity of a moving object due to linear f
orces which are acting on the body  and they are commonly used, due to force of gravity 
speeding up or slowing down we can combine a vehicle’s acceleration to calculate velocity and then distance travelled. Accelerometer data alone does not account for 
turns and non linear movement that is why it also contains a Gyroscope.
Gyroscope which measures angular velocity of three axes,roll about y-axis, pitch about x-axis and rate of rotation about z-axis,they don’t have any initial frame of
reference like accelerometer using both their datas, a sensor fusion basically techniques a vehicles position and orientation which can be easily calculated.Their 
data can also be used in GNSS based navigation system (it is basically a satellite based system that provides positioning,navigation and timing services to users on 
the planet and near the earth’s surfaces as well) to allow us for the use of precise tracking systems and detailed motion data to be gathered about a vehicle and then 
motion data can be combined with sensors such as speed or reverse gear signals for collision and detection analysis.
Another key use of IMU is dead reckoning (it is a navigation technique that estimates an object’s current position based on it’s previous known position,direction and
speed as well)
IMU chips also uses gnss data  as a reference point and thus it gathers information about vehicle’s movement and use calculations to determine an exact route before 
gnss signal is restored(gnss only reach metre accuracy whereas imu is important for sharing the most accurate data).
